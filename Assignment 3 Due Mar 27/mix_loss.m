function [l, g] = mix_loss(a, r)
%   [l, g] = MIX_LOSS(a, r)
%   Input:
%       a (column vector), the investment strategy (note a should be normalized so that sum(a) = 1)
%       r (column vector), stock changes on day t (compared with t-1)
%   Output:
%       l (number), the mix loss
%       g (column vector), the gradient of the mix loss (with respect to action a)

    l = -log(dot(a,r));
    g = -r/dot(a,r);
